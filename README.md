# Safe Navigation for a three wheels mobile robot through Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Analysis

## Abstract
Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis is a powerful tool able to solve safe navigation problems, in the literature it is mainly applied to aviation scenarios such as collision avoidance. In this paper we introduce in detail the theoretical concepts behind this tool and how to successfully apply it to solve a wheeled mobile robot control problem.
