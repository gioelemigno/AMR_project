In this paper we first introduced all the basic concepts of differential games necessary to Hamilton-Jacobi reachability, then we showed how to model a reachability problem in the more complex case, namely with a reach set and an avoid set, both time-varying. Then we concluded with the case of study and simulations of a three-wheeled robot in two different type of environments (static and dynamic).
