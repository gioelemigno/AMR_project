In this section we will see how all the previous theoretical concepts can be applied to solve a reachability problem, in which the system state has to reach a desired set $R$ while remains in the constraints set $K$ that represents the complementary of the set of states $A$ that correspond to a collision between the system and an obstacle in the real world.

Given the previous specifications, we can define two different kinds of reachability problems. In the first one we are interested in reaching safely $R$ exactly at the end of the game $(s=t)$, in the second instead, the system can reach safely $R$ at any $s$ inside the time horizon $[t, T]$. In the following we will focus our attention only on this last one.

Consider the system dynamics (\ref{ode}), the two functions $g(\cdot)$, $h(\cdot)$ defined in (\ref{g})(\ref{h}) and used to represent the target set $R$ and the constraint set $K$ respectively. As said before, the system dynamics admits a unique trajectory $x(s)$ from an initial state $x$ at time $t$ under inputs $u(\cdot)$ and $d(\cdot)$. We denote this solutions as:
\[
    \phi(s; x, t, u(\cdot), d(\cdot)) : [t, T] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n
\]

\subsection{Payoff Function}
We have already seen the payoff function of a reachability problem in which there is only a set to reach (\ref{eq:j_level_set}), now we have to consider also the constraints set $K$ and to do that we can use the following cost function \cite{new_paper}:
\begin{equation}
    \label{j_ras}
    J(x, t, u(\cdot), d(\cdot)) =  
        \min_{\tau \in [t, T]}
        \left\{
            \mathcal{J}(\tau, x, t, u(\cdot), d(\cdot))
        \right\}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{j_ras}
    \mathcal{J}(\tau, x, t, u(\cdot), d(\cdot)) =  
        \max
        \left\{
            g(\mathcal{X}(\tau), \tau), \max_{r \in [t, \tau]}h(\mathcal{X}(\tau), r)            
        \right\}
\end{equation}
Where: 
\[\mathcal{X}(\tau)=\phi(\tau; x, t, u(\cdot), d(\cdot))\]
